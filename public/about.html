<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a budding web developer with a strong passion for crafting intuitive and engaging user experiences. My journey in web development began with learning HTML, and it has opened up a world of creativity and problem-solving for me. I enjoy building projects that bring ideas to life on the web, and I’m always eager to expand my skills and explore new technologies in this ever-evolving field..</p>

<p>So far, I’ve developed a few exciting projects using HTML. One of my standout creations is a visually appealing birthday invitation, designed to be both functional and festive. I’ve also worked on a movie-ranking application that allows users to rank and interact with their favorite movies. These projects not only helped me solidify my understanding of HTML but also gave me a sense of how small design details can make a big difference in user experience.</p>

<p>As I continue my web development journey, I plan to learn CSS and JavaScript to make my projects even more dynamic and interactive. My ultimate goal is to master full-stack development, enabling me to create complete web applications. For now, I am focused on honing my skills step by step and creating a portfolio that reflects my growth and dedication to becoming a versatile web developer.</p>
